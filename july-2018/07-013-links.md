# Links for July 13 2018

Updated July 13, anyway I prefer to work on my own projects instead of copying and pasting, but some of the code in the link Clone and run could be useful for tracking contract state.
For the next Dapp try using [https://firebase.google.com/pricing/](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/)


and for the UI

* [(Top solidity tutorials)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/top-solidity-tutorials-4e7adcacced8)
* [Decentralized voting](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/developing-an-ethereum-decentralized-voting-application-a99de24992d9)
* [~~Solidity Space Doggos~~](https://www.bitdegree.org/courses/learn-solidity-space-doggos/)

In addition, next time have a wiki page for each project and the links I use
* [Copy some ideas from](https://github.com/shanejonas/react-box-web3-todo)
* [~~Clone and run~~](https://www.danielefavi.com/create-your-blockchain-dapp-with-ethereum-and-vuejs/)

Look into 

https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=vue%20web3

Seems incredibly useful.

In order to compile the contracts locally `truffle migrate --network development` is adequate, however 
this will cause the manually deployed contracts under `harvest/app/build/contracts` to be updated, so run after to ignore the build folder,
`git update-index --assume-unchanged build/contracts/*`

to track the truffle artifacts

`git update-index --no-assume-unchanged build/contracts/*`

hopefully merge that into a dapp dev article or something.


SOlgraph instead, chaning es2015 for properly complication
{
  presets: ['es2015']
}

Build a simple Vue Dapp that allows uses to deploy shit to ipfs
