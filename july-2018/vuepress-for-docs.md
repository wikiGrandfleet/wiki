# Vuepress

Despite interest in existing hugo themes such as (elaine, spelt wrong) ported from html5 UP, and the hugo lean launch them (https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-lean-launch-page/), and existing hexo themes including vexo, and futuristic.

I believe that vuepress is a great format, that support markdown plugins (plantuml and mermaid), in addition to existing vue components for dynamic content, also I can use vuetify for the UI components, but will probably not do that, and stick to the existing format from (craft-docs)[https://github.com/pixelandtonic/vuepress-theme-craftdocs] for future blockchain documentation projects, espeically becuase these files are simply ordered by path, with no header requried as in docusarus

this is far better for automatically producing markdown files from jsdoc in addition to solidity documentation using solmd or equivalent.

Hopefully I finish my simple token deployer by the end of the week or the end of next week and then I'll go into either aunction for 721 tokens or some chance based game in solidity or even perhaps a voting Dapp.
